With the rapid development of computer science, fast and secure transmission of data has gained great importance. 
Undoubtedly, one of the most common data types is digital images.
The attractiveness of digital images is result of wide range usage from social media to defense industry.
In order to transmit through correct and secure channels, images must be encrypted before they are sent. 
The relevant process is realized by means of encryption algorithms. 
Symmetric steams encryption algorithms which have been proposed so far have weaknesses in terms of speed and processing power. 
Therefore, encryption quality drops dramatically in certain scenarios. 
A novel symmetric stream encryption algorithm called XorShiftAnd has been proposed in this study.
